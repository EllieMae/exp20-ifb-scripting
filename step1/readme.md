# Step 1: Importing and Validating a form (basic)
In the first step, you'll get started by importing a pre-created custom input form into the LO Connect Admin Portal. We'll then verify that it works as expected before moving on to the other tasks.

## Prerequisites
This step requires: 
* An administrator Encompass Login that can be used to access [LO Connect](https://www.encompassloconnect.com)
* A non-Administrator Encompass Login that can be used to access [LO Connect](https://www.encompassloconnect.com)

# Instructions
Follow the steps below to complete this step. The files in this folder provide the initial form image you'll need for this step.

1. Using Chrome, log into the [LO Connect](https://www.encompassloconnect.com) web site using your administrator credentials.
2. On the left-hand navigation, select `Custromizartion > Custom Forms`.
3. Click the `Import` button and select the [Mortgage Rate Explorer - Step1.zip](Mortgage Rate Explorer - Step1.zip) file included in this step's GitHub folder. Once completed, you should have a form named "Experience 19 Demo Form".  
	NOTE: If you've already imported this form, it will ask if you want to overwrite it.  Unless you've done changes to it, go ahead and select yes.
4. Click the `Enabled` checkbox for the new form to allow it to be visible in LO Connect.
5. Open a new browser tab and log into LO Connect with a non-administrator credential.
6. On the Pipeline screen, select any sample loan to open it in the editor. (Please do not experiment on an actual loan file!)
7. On the left-hand navigation, select `Forms > Custom Input Forms > Mortgage Rate Explorer - Step1`. The form should appear and be populated with data. Try modifying one of the data elements, e.g. the Borrower's Name, and verify that the name changes in the header bar of the editor.

The demo form is now loaded and ready for the steps that follow. You can move on to Step #2.
