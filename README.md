# Encompass Custom Input Form Scripting Demo/Exercise
Goals of this exercise 
* Familiarity with Web-IFB
* Introduction to Web-IFB scripting
* Usage of EllieMae Scripting Framework objects

## Building a Mortgage Rate Explorer
This exercise utilizes the WYSIWYG based **Web Input Form Builder (Web-IFB)** to demonstrate the buildout of a simple form with fields that are bound to the loan as well as with fields that are not.  You will also learn how to use some of the newer EllieMae Scripting Framework object, such as the HTTP object to fetch external data.  

The exercise is broken out into a series of logical steps that layer upon each other to build the final solution. Feel free to jump to any section you'd like or straight to the final step to see the full project and source code.

## Building a Mortgage Rate Explorer Steps
The following is a table of contents for the details of each step.  Once you have completed all of the steps you should have a simplified but functioning Mortgage Rate Explorer.

### Step 1: Importing and Validating a form (basic)
In this first step we start off by importing a partially created form into our account.  We'll then enable the form and verify it is working as expected in LO Connect.

### Step 2: Using Web-IFB for laying out elements (basic)
Next, we will finalize our form's layout by adding the additional fields and then binding those to our loan.  

### Step 3: Custom scripting and the EllieMae Scripting Framework (basic)
Now that we have a working form, lets explore enhancing it with custom javascript.  For this step we will utilize the EllieMae Scripting Framework to access loan fields and conduct API calls.

### Step 4: Dynamic Forms (basic)
In this step, we will display the hidden "table" populated with the returned data from the API call we made in step 3.

### Final Solution
At this point you should have a fully functioning, if simplified, mortgage rate explorer tool.
